# CuratingGoethe

(migrated from our private/archived class repo - to be clear approximately half of this code is mine)

This is a Vue.js app that myself and three classmates built for CS100: Software Engineering in the Arts and Humanities. It makes use of Postgres along with the knex.js package for the databse and D3.js for the data visualization. We hosted the app on Heroku although our hosting has now expired.

We want to solve Professor Brown’s problem i.e. we want to allow users to be able to see the influences that Goethe’s poetry has had on subsequent music and allow analyses to be made based on these findings. Our proposed features include a search box allowing users to search through a database of music influenced by Goethe’s poems and filter their searches based on time period, instruments, country of origin etc. The API’s we will use are developer.musixmatch.com, spotify’s API and IMSLP.
