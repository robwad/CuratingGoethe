# CuratingGoethe

(migrated from our private/archived class repo - to be clear, approximately half of this code is mine - details in the Contributors.png file)

This is a Vue.js app that myself and three classmates built for CS100: Software Engineering in the Arts and Humanities. It makes use of Postgres along with the knex.js package for the databse and D3.js for the data visualization. We hosted the app on Heroku although our hosting has now expired.

We wanted to solve Harvard Professor Brown’s problem i.e. we wanted to allow users to be able to see the influences that Goethe’s poetry has had on music throughout the ages and allow analyses to be made based on these findings. Our features included a search box allowing users to search through a database of music influenced by Goethe’s poems and filter their searches based on time period, instruments, country of origin etc. The results are then displayed alongside data visualizations using the API from D3.js. We used the IMSLP API to create the database.
